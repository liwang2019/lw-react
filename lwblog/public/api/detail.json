The inscription, titled A letter to the future, on the monument paints a bleak picture.</p> <p>Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and know what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it, the plaque reads in English and Icelandic.</p><img src='https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190722161738-iceland-glacier-climate-change-exlarge-169.jpg'/><p>From the ice sheet in Greenland to the towering glaciers in West Antarctica, Earth's enormous masses of ice are melting fast. And though sea levels have risen and fallen throughout history, scientists say it's never happened at a rate this fast. </p>"
